                <h2>The great Indian Presedent</h2>
                <p>
                    A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, (born Oct. 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian
                    president (2002–07).
                    After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology, Kalam played a leading role in the
                    development of India’s
                    missile and nuclear weapons programs. He planned a program that produced a number of successful
                    missiles, helping earn
                    him the nickname “Missile Man.” Beginning in the early 1990s, he also served as scientific adviser
                    to the government,
                    and his prominent role in India’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests established Kalam as a national hero.
                    In 2002 the Hindu
                    nationalist (Hindutva) National Democratic Alliance nominated Kalam, a Muslim, to succeed outgoing
                    President K.R.
                    Narayanan. Kalam easily won the elections in 2002, and in the largely ceremonial post he sought to
                    use science and
                    technology to transform India into a developed country. In 2007 he was succeeded by Pratibha Patil,
                    the country’s first
                    woman president.Great personalities are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are
                    remembered for millennials to come.
                    his contribution to the country he
                    remained immortal in the hearts of people. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was one such personality who died at
                    83. It was shocking
                    news for the entire country as a pure soul left us forever. Abdul Kalam while delivering a speech
                    for the youth in an
                    event at IIM Shillong. During the middle of the speech, he suffered from a cardiac arrest and
                    collapsed. Although he got
                    admitted to the best hospital in Shillong, the doctors could not save him.Then his body was
                    airlifted to Gugati, and
                    from there, it was taken to New Delhi in an Airforce plane. Their President, vice president, and
                    some other leaders
                    prayed for his soul. His body was then covered in the Indian National flag and brought to his
                    hometown. About 35000
                    people attended his funeral event and prayed for such a great soul.Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography
